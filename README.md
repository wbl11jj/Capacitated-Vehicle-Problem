# Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem(CVRP)

CVRP is a VRP in which vehicles with limited carrying capacity need to pick up or deliver items at various locations. The items have a quantity, such as weight or volume, and the vehicles have a maximum capacity that they can carry.

## Goal

Determine the optimal route for a vehicle to deliver goods to customers while fulfilling various constraints.
Combine three of the algorithms into one, making a hybrid

## Methods used

- Floyd Algorithm(algorithm for finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph)
- Dynamic Programming(an idea of breaking the problem into smaller, individualized components)
- Greedy Algorithms(algorithm that constructs a solution to the problem by always making a choice that looks the best at the moment)
